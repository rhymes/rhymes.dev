Hi, I'm rhymes.

I am an experienced programmer, my pronouns are he/him.

Most recently I worked at [Forem](https://www.forem.com/) from May 2019 until October 2021, raising to the level of Principal Software Engineer. I was working as an opensource maintainer and contributing to the entire stack: DB, search, API, frontend, general feature development, mentoring, architecture design and evaluation and testing of security reports, all while keeping an eye on speed and optimization, sharing knowledge with wonderful coworkers and learning from them.

Although it's not at all the best of metrics you can see [some of those contributions](https://github.com/forem/forem/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arhymes). One of the my last projects over there was to migrate the search backend from Elasticsearch to PostgreSQL's full text search.

Before that I wrote servers, web apps and tools for more than a decade in Python, Ruby and JavaScript.

I value transparency, privacy, [boring technologies](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) and I usually [rant on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rhymes_) about performance, unnecessary complexity in software and data collection.
