Hi, I'm rhymes.

I am a programmer, my pronouns are he/him.

I have been a professional software developer for 15+ years.

Most recently I have been employed as a Principal Software Engineer at [Forem](https://www.forem.com/) until October 2021.
Although it's not at all the best of metrics you can see [some of those contributions](https://github.com/forem/forem/commits?author=rhymes).

I value transparency, privacy, [boring technologies](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) and I usually [rant on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rhymes_) about performance, unnecessary complexity in software and data collection.
